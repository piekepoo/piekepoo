			<h2>Shenanigans</h2><br><br>
			<h3>w/ Gaia Manganello and Giulio Barbero</h3>
			<div class="para">
			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>Shenanigans is a game of politics made with Open Frameworks. Choose your favourite world-politician and bombard your political opponents by shooting at them with tweets.</p>
			<h3>Concept</h3>
			<p>In a world where politics has become a circus, it’s not about governing a country anymore, but it’s similar to a soap opera in which the main characters are teasing each other and are trying to find weak spots to expose each other. Social media, as we all know, sometimes give childish behaviours a place to be; heads of state make no exception, to the point where their attempts to look good to the detriment of their counterparts look less like official debate and much more like shenanigans. We tried to visualize this political climate of a Twitter War by translating the political space into a game, in which you choose to represent one of 10 possible country leaders/ministers. A random opponent is selected to bombard you with tweets and online insults or gossip. The idea is to avoid these virtual attacks; translating to if you successfully dodge the tweets, your general public image is kept safe and you can stay in your position. After you’re hit by 3 scandals, you die: your time as a country representative is over.</p>
			<h3>Motivation</h3>
			<p>We took the theme of space and interpreted it as a general climate, in this case the political climate. We feel like politics has become a joke in a way, because you can see a lot of leaders that seem incompetent, but still they managed to get their position. We feel like this is made possible because it is not really about having the right skills, but it’s more like a game in which you have to win over the general public. The consequences are total chaos when it comes to maintaining international relations, in which online traffic/messages/tweets dominate as a way of international communication. For individual politicians, it seems like a main part of their success is defined by staying away from drama and public scandals: it’s in a way about keeping up appearances. We wanted to add an interactive part to it, by linking the virtual space and real space (you have to physically move to take part in the virtual space).</p>
			<h3>Implementation</h3>
			<p>We used the OpenFrameworks programming environment and an ofxOpenCv addon that allows the program to detect contours from the video streamed by the camera. In particular it detects holes that are then all tracked and converted into a variable controlling the movement of the player cursor. In this way the result is more “shaky” but with a better approximation. The game itself is sequenced in 3 states (start, game, end) to coordinate when to take a picture of the background (as a reference when the player moves), when to start spawning enemies and to know the score.</p>
